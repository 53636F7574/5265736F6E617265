# Overview
This program is a server-hopping protocol that produces an advanced
encryption algorithm for the transmission and storage
of sensitive documents and other information.

# Features
At the core of the program, we have dynamic encryption occuring, but
outside of that, there are other features that make the protocol 
functional.

A key feature of this program is its built in auto restoration, that
allows for corrupted files to be repaired upon confirmed reception.
This is due to the advanced branching linked list struct. and the 
tag markers for lost nodes that belonged to said transmisson to be
recovered.

Another feature is the sacrificial branches that prevent hackers
from obtaining the address to the prior or next node when a portion
of the transmission is recovered or identified by unautorized users.

# Status
This program is currently in the works at this time and has been
prototyped via dynamic programming on several web servers.









Hard to trace and even harder to decrypt.
